## Part A
### Connectome prediction
Based on data from The Autism Brain Image Data Exchange Project (https://www.frontiersin.org/10.3389/conf.fninf.2013.09.00041/event_abstract), the main goal of the homework is to extract, pre-process, feature engineeer and fit a machine learning model to predict whether or not a particular patient has a mental disorder or not.
#### Methods:
*Kernel Principal Component Analysis*, *Support Vector Machines*, *Random Forest*

## Part B
### Variable importance 
Use the LOCO (Leave One Covariate Out) to evaluate variable importance in a subset of 10 features from the previous data.


## Part C
### Ovid Heroides metric analysis with kernel test
Implement a Kernel based two-sample test to check if there is a statistically significant stylometric difference in Ovid's work (analyzed as Compositional data) between the periods of his work.
